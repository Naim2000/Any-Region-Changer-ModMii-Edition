# Any Region Changer: Modmii Edition

Any Region Changer: ModMii Edition (Otherwise known as ARCME) allows you to edit any and all of the region information on your Wii.
The setting changes are non-temporary, i.e. they persist after system reboot.

You should have the Homebrew Channel installed so you can revert any changes pre or post reboot if needed.

## Compiling
You need to install [devKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and [RuntimeIOSPatch](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-vwii-libruntimeiospatch.339606/?msclkid=9449fb2ac11111eca5087aab4842d005).
If you are using Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) if avalible.
Once all required tools are installed, run `make` in the same folder as  `Makefile`.

## Warnings
 - If setting.txt is corrupted for any reason, it is entirely possible that your Wii will no longer boot. 
 - If you change the GAME ("Game Region") setting, you may no longer be able to boot discs!
 - Be careful not to change Video mode to a mode unsupported by your display.
 - If you change your Country code, you will be unable to receive any pending gifts you have in the Wii Shop Channel. (The shop will also warn you of this)
 - Setting the AREA setting ("Console Area Setting") to a different region than your System Menu WILL cause a Semi-Brick! If for some reason your System-Configured flag is unset (via some installation, or a corrupted SYSCONF) your system WILL become FULLY BRICKED.
